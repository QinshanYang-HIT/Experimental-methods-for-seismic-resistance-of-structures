# Experimental-methods-for-seismic-resistance-of-structures
It's the assignment 2 of Experimental Methods for Seismic Resistance of Structures, mainly includes how to calculate the ***natural vibration frequency*** and ***damping ratio*** of the structure.
## Natural Vibration Frequency
The natural vibration frequency of the structure is obtained by **Fourier transform**.Some of the results are shown below.

## Damping Ratio
The structural damping ratio is calculated from the **logarithmic attenuation rate**, and some results are as follows.
